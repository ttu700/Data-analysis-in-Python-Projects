## [Project 1: MeanVarStd Calculator](https://github.com/ttu700/Data-analysis-in-Python-Projects/tree/1212e8f9b89dd80e80af205b6387ae1124ed9bce/freecodecamp%20projects/p1%20mean-var-std-calc)
Explore a calculator providing insights into mean, variance, and standard deviation for a 3x3 matrix.

## [Project 2: Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/ttu700/Data-analysis-in-Python-Projects/tree/1212e8f9b89dd80e80af205b6387ae1124ed9bce/freecodecamp%20projects/p2%20demographic-data-analyzer) 
Explore my Pandas-powered Demographic Data Analyzer project, where I delve into a dataset extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Leveraging Python, I answer key questions such as race representation, average age of men, and income analysis based on education levels. Uncover insights about working hours, and income distribution, and discover which country has the highest percentage of high earners.

## [Project 3: Medical Data Analyzer](https://github.com/ttu700/Data-analysis-in-Python-Projects/tree/1212e8f9b89dd80e80af205b6387ae1124ed9bce/freecodecamp%20projects/p3%20medical-data-visualizer)
Discover my Medical Data Visualizer project, a compelling analysis of medical examination data using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. Leveraging a dataset collected during medical examinations, I explore the relationships between body measurements, blood markers, lifestyle choices, and cardiovascular diseases.

## [Project 4: Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/ttu700/Data-analysis-in-Python-Projects/tree/1212e8f9b89dd80e80af205b6387ae1124ed9bce/freecodecamp%20projects/p4%20page-view-time-series-visualizer) 
Dive into my Page View Time Series Visualizer project, where I leverage Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and visualize a dataset containing the daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from May 9, 2016, to December 3, 2019. This project aims to uncover patterns, identify growth trends, and present insights through various visualizations.
